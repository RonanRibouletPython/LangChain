       "'Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) is a type of attention mechanism used in neural networks, specifically in the Transformer architecture. It is called \"scaled dot-product attention\" because it computes the attention weights by taking the dot product of the query and key vectors, scaling each vector by 1/√dk, and applying a softmax function to obtain the final weights.\\n\\nIn SDPA, the input consists of queries, keys, and values, all of which are vectors in dk dimensions. The attention function is computed as:\\n\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT√dk)V (1)\\n\\nwhere Q, K, and V are matrices of queries, keys, and values, respectively. The scaling factor of 1/√dk is introduced to stabilize the computation when dealing with large values of dk.\\n\\nThe two most common attention mechanisms are additive attention and dot-product (multi-plicative) attention. While both mechanisms perform similarly in small dimensions, dot-product attention outperforms additive attention without scaling for larger dimensions dk. The reason for this is that the dot products of the queries and keys grow large in magnitude as dk increases, causing the softmax function to have extremely small gradients. To address this issue, SDPA scales the dot products by 1/√dk.\\n\\nMulti-head attention is another variation of attention mechanisms that involves performing multiple attention functions in parallel with different learned linear projections. This allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.'"
